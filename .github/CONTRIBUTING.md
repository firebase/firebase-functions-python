```

### Deploying a sample for testing

Example:

```sh
cd samples/basic_https
firebase deploy --only=functions
```

Note to test your local changes of `firebase-functions` when deploying you should push your changes to a branch on GitHub and then locally in the `sample/*/requirements.txt` change `firebase-functions` dependency line to instead come from git, e.g. :

```
git+https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/firebase-functions-python.git@YOURBRANCH#egg=firebase-functions
```
